# Development Notes

## HERO VALIDATION
	- Experience validation depends directly of the level, being the min exp the required for the max exp of the level of before + 1 and the max of the current level
	- Attack and defense must be the expected stat by level with a range of +-5
	- HP shouldnt be 0

## Next Step
	- Implement the game logic
	- Implement the GUI game view
	- Implement the Console game view
	- Implement the battles


## To Add
	- en GUIBuilder -> in buildHeroListing() -> add the if inGame that are commented
	- en Console_View -> createHero() -> add the game redirect (last line before the throw)

## To Fix

## To Refactor
	- GuiBuilder is ugly code, I can improve something 100% (Some functions are not intuitive due to its multi-use)!!!



## THOUGHTS
	- OUT OF GAME THE DB MAY BE MODIFIED, CAREFUL
