# Development Notes

## Next Step
	- Implement the game logic
	- Implement the GUI game view
	- Implement the Console game view
	- Implement the battles


## To Add
	- en GUIBuilder -> in buildHeroListing() -> add the if inGame that are commented
	- en Console_View -> createHero() -> add the game redirect (last line before the throw)

## To Fix

## To Refactor
	- GuiBuilder is ugly code, I can improve something 100% (Some functions are not intuitive due to its multi-use)!!!
